# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is contrasted from supervised learning because it uses an __unlabeled__ training set rather than a labeled one.

In other words, we don't have the vector y of expected results, we only have a dataset of features where we can find structure.

Clustering is good for:

* Market segmentation
* Social network analysis
* Organizing computer clusters
* Astronomical data analysis
