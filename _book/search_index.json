Arthur Samuel described it as: \"the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\" This is an older, informal definition.\nTom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"\n Example: playing checkers.\nE = the experience of playing many games of checkers\nT = the task of playing checkers.\nP = the probability that the program will win the next game.\nIn general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:\nSupervised learning and Unsupervised learning.\nSupervised Learning\nIn supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.\nSupervised learning problems are categorized into regression and classification problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.\nExample 1:\nGiven data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.\nWe could turn this example into a classification problem by instead making our output about whether the house \"sells for more or less than the asking price.\" Here we are classifying the houses based on price into two discrete categories.\n Example 2:\n(a) Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture\n(b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.\nUnsupervised Learning\nUnsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.\nWe can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.\nWith unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.\nExample:\nClustering: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.\nNon-clustering: The \"Cocktail Party Algorithm\", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a cocktail party).\n"},"Week_1/ModelRepresentation.html":{"url":"Week_1/ModelRepresentation.html","title":"Model Representation","keywords":"","body":"Model Representation\nLecture: Model and Cost Function\nLecture: Linear Algebra\n"},"Week_1/ModelRepresentation/ModelCostFunction.html":{"url":"Week_1/ModelRepresentation/ModelCostFunction.html","title":"Model and Cost Function","keywords":"","body":"Model Representation\nTo establish notation for future use, we’ll use \nx(i) to denote the “input” variables (living area in this example), also called input features, and y(i) to denote the “output” or target variable that we are trying to predict (price). A pair (x(i),y(i)); i = 1,...,m is called a training example, and the dataset that we’ll be using to learn—a list of m training examples (x(i),y(i));i=1,...,m—is called a training set. Note that the superscript “(i)” in the notation is simply an index into the training set, and has nothing to do with exponentiation. We will also use X to denote the space of input values, and Y to denote the space of output values. \nIn this example, X = Y = ℝ.\nTo describe the supervised learning problem slightly more formally, our goal is, given a training set, to learn a function h : X → Y so that h(x) is a “good” predictor for the corresponding value of y. For historical reasons, this function h is called a hypothesis. Seen pictorially, the process is therefore like this:\n\nCost Function\nWe can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function. This takes an average difference (actually a fancier version of an average) of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's and the actual output y's.\n\nThis function is otherwise called the \"Squared error function\", or \"Mean squared error\". The mean is halved (1/2) as a convenience for the computation of the gradient descent, as the derivative term of the square function will cancel out the 1/2 term.\nCost Function - Intuition I\nIf we try to think of it in visual terms, our training data set is scattered on the x-y plane. We are trying to make a straight line (defined by hθ(x) which passes through these scattered data points.\nOur objective is to get the best possible line. The best possible line will be such so that the average squared vertical distances of the scattered points from the line will be the least. Ideally, the line should pass through all the points of our training data set. In such a case, the value of J(θ0,θ1) will be 0. The following example shows the ideal situation where we have a cost function of 0.\n\nWhen θ1 = 1, we get a slope of 1 which goes through every single data point in our model. Conversely, when θ1 = 0.5, we see the vertical distance from our fit to the data points increase.\n\nThis increases our cost function to 0.58. Plotting several other points yields to the following graph:\n\nThus as a goal, we should try to minimize the cost function. In this case, θ1 = 1 is our global minimum.\nCost Function - Intuition II\nA contour plot is a graph that contains many contour lines. A contour line of a two variable function has a constant value at all points of the same line. An example of such a graph is the one to the right below.\n\nTaking any color and going along the 'circle', one would expect to get the same value of the cost function. For example, the three green points found on the green line above have the same value for J(θ0,θ1) and as a result, they are found along the same line. The circled x displays the value of the cost function for the graph on the left when θ0 = 800 and θ1 = -0.15. Taking another h(x) and plotting its contour plot, one gets the following graphs:\n\nWhen θ0 = 360 and θ1 = 0, the value of J(θ0,θ1) in the contour plot gets closer to the center thus reducing the cost function error. Now giving our hypothesis function a slightly positive slope results in a better fit of the data.\n\nThe graph above minimizes the cost function as much as possible and consequently, the result of θ1 and θ0 tend to be around 0.12 and 250 respectively. Plotting those values on our graph to the right seems to put our point in the center of the inner most 'circle'.\n"},"Week_1/ModelRepresentation/ParameterLearning.html":{"url":"Week_1/ModelRepresentation/ParameterLearning.html","title":"Parameter Learning","keywords":"","body":"Gradient Descent\nSo we have our hypothesis function and we have a way of measuring how well it fits into the data. Now we need to estimate the parameters in the hypothesis function. That's where gradient descent comes in.\nImagine that we graph our hypothesis function based on its fields θ0 and θ1 (actually we are graphing the cost function as a function of the parameter estimates). We are not graphing x and y itself, but the parameter range of our hypothesis function and the cost resulting from selecting a particular set of parameters.\nWe put θ0 on the x axis and θ1 on the y axis, with the cost function on the vertical z axis. The points on our graph will be the result of the cost function using our hypothesis with those specific theta parameters. The graph below depicts such a setup.\n\nWe will know that we have succeeded when our cost function is at the very bottom of the pits in our graph, i.e. when its value is the minimum. The red arrows show the minimum points in the graph.\nThe way we do this is by taking the derivative (the tangential line to a function) of our cost function. The slope of the tangent is the derivative at that point and it will give us a direction to move towards. We make steps down the cost function in the direction with the steepest descent. The size of each step is determined by the parameter α, which is called the learning rate.\nFor example, the distance between each 'star' in the graph above represents a step determined by our parameter α. A smaller α would result in a smaller step and a larger α results in a larger step. The direction in which the step is taken is determined by the partial derivative of J(θ0,θ1). Depending on where one starts on the graph, one could end up at different points. The image above shows us two different starting points that end up in two different places.\nThe gradient descent algorithm is:\nrepeat until convergence:\n\nwhere:\nj = 0,1 represents the feature index number.\nAt each iteration j, one should simultaneously update the parameters θ1,θ2,...θn. Updating a specific parameter prior to calculating another one on the j(th) iteration would yield to a wrong implementation.\nGradient Descent Intuition\nThe following graph shows that when the slope is negative, the value of θ1 increases and when it is positive, the value of θ1 decreases.\n\nOn a side note, we should adjust our parameter α to ensure that the gradient descent algorithm converges in a reasonable time. Failure to converge or too much time to obtain the minimum value imply that our step size is wrong.\n\nHow does gradient descent converge with a fixed step size α?\nThe intuition behind the convergence is that the partial derivative approaches 0 as we approach the bottom of our convex function. At the minimum, the derivative will always be 0 and thus we get:\n    θ1 := θ1 −α∗0\nGradient Descent for Linear Regression\nWhen specifically applied to the case of linear regression, a new form of the gradient descent equation can be derived. We can substitute our actual cost function and our actual hypothesis function and modify the equation to :\n\nwhere m is the size of the training set, θ0 a constant that will be changing simultaneously with θ1 and xi,yi are values of the given training set (data).\nNote that we have separated out the two cases for θj into separate equations for θ0​    and θ1; and that for θ1    we are multiplying xi at the end due to the derivative. The following is a derivation for a single example :\n\nThe point of all this is that if we start with a guess for our hypothesis and then repeatedly apply these gradient descent equations, our hypothesis will become more and more accurate.\nSo, this is simply gradient descent on the original cost function J. This method looks at every example in the entire training set on every step, and is called batch gradient descent. Note that, while gradient descent can be susceptible to local minima in general, the optimization problem we have posed here for linear regression has only one global, and no other local, optima; thus gradient descent always converges (assuming the learning rate α is not too large) to the global minimum. Indeed, J is a convex quadratic function. \nHere is an example of gradient descent as it is run to minimize a quadratic function.\n\n"},"Week_1/ModelRepresentation/MatricesVectors.html":{"url":"Week_1/ModelRepresentation/MatricesVectors.html","title":"Linear Algebra","keywords":"","body":"Matrices and Vectors\nMatrices are 2-dimensional arrays: example 4(columns) x 4(rows)\nA vector is a matrix with one column and many rows: example 4 x 1 matrix\nSo vectors are a subset of matrices.\n\nAij refers to the element in the ith row and jth column of matrix A.\nA vector with 'n' rows is referred to as an 'n'-dimensional vector.\nvi refers to the element in the ith row of the vector.\nIn general, all our vectors and matrices will be 1-indexed.

This allows us to do matrix operations with theta and x. Hence making the two vectors 'θ' and x(i) match each other element-wise (that is, have the same number of elements: n+1).\nGradient Descent For Multiple Variables\nThe gradient descent equation itself is generally the same form; we just have to repeat it for our 'n' features:\n\nIn other words:\n\nThe following image compares gradient descent with one variable to gradient descent with multiple variables:\n\nGradient Descent in Practice I - Feature Scaling\nWe can speed up gradient descent by having each of our input values in roughly the same range. This is because θ will descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven.\nThe way to prevent this is to modify the ranges of our input variables so that they are all roughly the same. Ideally:\n−1 ≤ x(i) ≤ 1\nor\n−0.5 ≤ x(i) ≤ 0.5\nThese aren't exact requirements; we are only trying to speed things up. The goal is to get all input variables into roughly one of these ranges, give or take a few.\nTwo techniques to help with this are feature scaling and mean normalization. Feature scaling involves dividing the input values by the range (i.e. the maximum value minus the minimum value) of the input variable, resulting in a new range of just 1. Mean normalization involves subtracting the average value for an input variable from the values for that input variable resulting in a new average value for the input variable of just zero. To implement both of these techniques, adjust your input values as shown in this formula:\nxi := (xi − μi) / si\n​\nWhere μi is the average of all the values for feature (i) and si is the range of values (max - min), or si is the standard deviation.\nNote that dividing by the range, or dividing by the standard deviation, give different results.\n​For example, if xi represents housing prices with a range of 100 to 2000 and a mean value of 1000, then, \nxi := (price − 1000) / 1900\nExample:\n\nSo for any individual feature f:\nf_norm = (f - f_mean) / (f_max - f_min)\n\ne.g. for x2,(midterm exam)^2 = {7921, 5184, 8836, 4761}\n\n> x2  mean(x2)\n 6676\n> max(x2) - min(x2)\n 4075\n>(x2 - mean(x2)) / (max(x2) - min(x2))\n 0.306  -0.366  0.530 -0.470\n Hence norm(5184) = 0.366\nGradient Descent in Practice II - Learning Rate\nDebugging gradient descent. Make a plot with number of iterations on the x-axis. Now plot the cost function, J(θ) over the number of iterations of gradient descent. If J(θ) ever increases, then you probably need to decrease α.\nAutomatic convergence test. Declare convergence if J(θ) decreases by less than E in one iteration, where E is some small value such as 10−3. However in practice it's difficult to choose this threshold value.\nIt has been proven that if learning rate α is sufficiently small, then J(θ) will decrease on every iteration.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nIf α is too small: slow convergence.\n\nIf α is too large: may not decrease on every iteration and thus may not converge.\n\n\nFeatures and Polynomial Regression\nWe can improve our features and the form of our hypothesis function in a couple different ways.\nWe can combine multiple features into one. For example, we can combine x1 and x2 into a new feature x3 by taking x1 * x2.\nPolynomial Regression\nOur hypothesis function need not be linear (a straight line) if that does not fit the data well.\nWe can change the behavior or curve of our hypothesis function by making it a quadratic, cubic or square root function (or any other form).\nFor example, if our hypothesis function is hθ(x)= θ0 + θ1x1 then we can create additional features based on x1, to get the quadratic function hθ(x)= θ0 + θ1x1+θ2x1^2 or the cubic function hθ(x)= θ0 + θ1x1 + θ2x1^2 + θ3x1^3.\nIn the cubic version, we have created new features x2 and x3 where x2 = x1^2 and x3 = x1^3.\nTo make it a square root function, we could do: \nhθ(x) = θ0 + θ1x1 + θ2root(x1)      \nOne important thing to keep in mind is, if you choose your features this way then feature scaling becomes very important.\n"},"Week_2/ComputingParametersAnalytically/ComputingParametersAnalytically.html":{"url":"Week_2/ComputingParametersAnalytically/ComputingParametersAnalytically.html","title":"Computing Parameters Analytically","keywords":"","body":"Normal Equation\nGradient descent gives one way of minimizing J. Let’s discuss a second way of doing so, this time performing the minimization explicitly and without resorting to an iterative algorithm. In the \"Normal Equation\" method, we will minimize J by explicitly taking its derivatives with respect to the θj’s, and setting them to zero. This allows us to find the optimum theta without iteration. The normal equation formula is given below:\n\n\nThere is no need to do feature scaling with the normal equation.\nThe following is a comparison of gradient descent and the normal equation:\n\nWith the normal equation, computing the inversion has complexity \nO(n3). So if we have a very large number of features, the normal equation will be slow. In practice, when n exceeds 10,000 it might be a good time to go from a normal solution to an iterative process.\nNormal Equation Noninvertibility\nWhen implementing the normal equation in octave we want to use the 'pinv' function rather than 'inv.' The 'pinv' function will give you a value of θ even if XTX is not invertible.\nIf XTX is non invertible, the common causes might be having :\n\nRedundant features, where two features are very closely related (i.e. they are linearly dependent)\n\nToo many features (e.g. m ≤ n).

However, this method doesn't work well because classification is not actually a linear function.\nThe classification problem is just like the regression problem, except that the values we now want to predict take on only a small number of discrete values. For now, we will focus on the binary classification problem in which y can take on only two values, 0 and 1. (Most of what we say here will also generalize to the multiple-class case.) For instance, if we are trying to build a spam classifier for email, then x(i) may be some features of a piece of email, and y may be 1 if it is a piece of spam mail, and 0 otherwise. Hence, y∈{0,1}. 0 is also called the negative class, and 1 the positive class, and they are sometimes also denoted by the symbols “-” and “+.” Given x(i), the corresponding y(i) is also called the label for the training example.\nHypothesis Representation\nWe could approach the classification problem ignoring the fact that y is discrete-valued, and use our old linear regression algorithm to try to predict y given x. However, it is easy to construct examples where this method performs very poorly. Intuitively, it also doesn’t make sense for \nhθ(x) to take values larger than 1 or smaller than 0 when we know that y ∈ {0, 1}. To fix this, let’s change the form for our hypotheses \nhθ(x) to satisfy 0 ≤ hθ(x) ≤ 1. This is accomplished by plugging θTx into the Logistic Function.\nOur new form uses the \"Sigmoid Function,\" also called the \"Logistic Function\":\n\nThe following image shows us what the sigmoid function looks like:\n\nThe function g(z), shown here, maps any real number to the (0, 1) interval, making it useful for transforming an arbitrary-valued function into a function better suited for classification.\nhθ(x) will give us the probability that our output is 1. For example, hθ(x) = 0.7 gives us a probability of 70% that our output is 1. Our probability that our prediction is 0 is just the complement of our probability that it is 1 (e.g. if probability that it is 1 is 70%, then the probability that it is 0 is 30%).\n\nDecision Boundary\nIn order to get our discrete 0 or 1 classification, we can translate the output of the hypothesis function as follows:\n\nThe way our logistic function g behaves is that when its input is greater than or equal to zero, its output is greater than or equal to 0.5:\n\nRemember.\n\nSo if our input to g is θTX, then that means:\n\nFrom these statements we can now say:\n\nThe decision boundary is the line that separates the area where y = 0 and where y = 1. It is created by our hypothesis function.\nExample:\n\nIn this case, our decision boundary is a straight vertical line placed on the graph where x1 = 5, and everything to the left of that denotes y = 1, while everything to the right denotes y = 0.\nAgain, the input to the sigmoid function g(z) doesn't need to be linear, and could be a function that describes a circle or any shape to fit our data.\n"},"Week_3/LogisticRegression/LogisticRegression.html":{"url":"Week_3/LogisticRegression/LogisticRegression.html","title":"Logistic Regression","keywords":"","body":"Logistic Regression Model\nCost Function\nWe cannot use the same cost function that we use for linear regression because the Logistic Function will cause the output to be wavy, causing many local optima. In other words, it will not be a convex function.\nInstead, our cost function for logistic regression looks like:\n\nWhen y = 1, we get the following plot for J(θ) vs hθ(x):\n\nWhen y = 0, we get the following plot for J(θ) vs hθ(x):\n\n\nIf our correct answer 'y' is 0, then the cost function will be 0 if our hypothesis function also outputs 0. If our hypothesis approaches 1, then the cost function will approach infinity.\nIf our correct answer 'y' is 1, then the cost function will be 0 if our hypothesis function outputs 1. If our hypothesis approaches 0, then the cost function will approach infinity.\nNote that writing the cost function in this way guarantees that J(θ) is convex for logistic regression.\nSimplified Cost Function and Gradient Descent\nWe can compress our cost function's two conditional cases into one case:\nCost(hθ(x),y) = −ylog(hθ(x)) − (1−y)log(1−hθ(x))\nNotice that when y is equal to 1, then the second term (1−y)log(1−hθ(x)) will be zero and will not affect the result. If y is equal to 0, then the first term −ylog(hθ(x)) will be zero and will not affect the result.\nWe can fully write out our entire cost function as follows:\n\nA vectorized implementation is:\n\nGradient Descent\nRemember that the general form of gradient descent is:\n\nWe can work out the derivative part using calculus to get:\n\nNotice that this algorithm is identical to the one we used in linear regression. We still have to simultaneously update all values in theta.\nA vectorized implementation is:\nθ:= θ − (α / m)* X'(g(Xθ)− y)\nAlso:\n\nAdvanced Optimization\n\"Conjugate gradient\", \"BFGS\", and \"L-BFGS\" are more sophisticated, faster ways to optimize θ that can be used instead of gradient descent. We suggest that you should not write these more sophisticated algorithms yourself (unless you are an expert in numerical computing) but use the libraries instead, as they're already tested and highly optimized. Octave provides them.\nWe first need to provide a function that evaluates the following two functions for a given input value θ:\n* J(θ)\n* (∂ / ∂θj) * J(θ)\nWe can write a single function that returns both of these:\n    function [jVal, gradient] = costFunction(theta)\n          jVal = [...code to compute J(theta)...];\n          gradient = [...code to compute derivative of J(theta)...];\n    end\nThen we can use octave's \"fminunc()\" optimization algorithm along with the \"optimset()\" function that creates an object containing the options we want to send to \"fminunc()\".\noptions = optimset('GradObj', 'on', 'MaxIter', 100);\ninitialTheta = zeros(2,1);\n   [optTheta, functionVal, exitFlag] = fminunc(@costFunction, initialTheta, options);\nWe give to the function \"fminunc()\" our cost function, our initial vector of theta values, and the \"options\" object that we created beforehand.\nMulticlass Classification: One-vs-all\nNow we will approach the classification of data when we have more than two categories. Instead of y = {0,1} we will expand our definition so that y = {0,1...n}.\nSince y = {0,1...n}, we divide our problem into n+1 (+1 because the index starts at 0) binary classification problems; in each one, we predict the probability that 'y' is a member of one of our classes.\n\nWe are basically choosing one class and then lumping all the others into a single second class. We do this repeatedly, applying binary logistic regression to each case, and then use the hypothesis that returned the highest value as our prediction.\nThe following image shows how one could classify 3 classes:\n\nTo summarize:\nTrain a logistic regression classifier hθ(x) for each class￼to predict the probability that y = i.\nTo make a prediction on a new x, pick the class that maximizes hθ(x).\n"},"Week_3/OverfittingProblem/OverfittingProblem.html":{"url":"Week_3/OverfittingProblem/OverfittingProblem.html","title":"Solving the Problem of Overfitting","keywords":"","body":"Solving the Problem of Overfitting\nConsider the problem of predicting y from x ∈ R. The leftmost figure below shows the result of fitting a y = θ0+θ1\nto a dataset. We see that the data doesn’t really lie on straight line, and so the fit is not very good.\n\nInstead, if we had added an extra feature x2, and fit y = θ0+θ1x+θ2x^2, then we obtain a slightly better fit to the data (See middle figure). Naively, it might seem that the more features we add, the better. However, there is also a danger in adding too many features: The rightmost figure is the result of fitting a 5th order polynomial y = ∑j = 05θjx^j. We see that even though the fitted curve passes through the data perfectly, we would not expect this to be a very good predictor of, say, housing prices (y) for different living areas (x). Without formally defining what these terms mean, we’ll say the figure on the left shows an instance of underfitting—in which the data clearly shows structure not captured by the model—and the figure on the right is an example of overfitting.\nUnderfitting, or high bias, is when the form of our hypothesis function h maps poorly to the trend of the data. It is usually caused by a function that is too simple or uses too few features. At the other extreme, overfitting, or high variance, is caused by a hypothesis function that fits the available data but does not generalize well to predict new data. It is usually caused by a complicated function that creates a lot of unnecessary curves and angles unrelated to the data.\nThis terminology is applied to both linear and logistic regression. There are two main options to address the issue of overfitting:\n1) Reduce the number of features:\n\nManually select which features to keep.\nUse a model selection algorithm (studied later in the course).\n\n2) Regularization\n\nKeep all the features, but reduce the magnitude of parameters θj.\nRegularization works well when we have a lot of slightly useful features.\n\nCost Function\nIf we have overfitting from our hypothesis function, we can reduce the weight that some of the terms in our function carry by increasing their cost.\nSay we wanted to make the following function more quadratic:\nθ0+θ1x+θ2x^2+θ3x^3+θ4x^4\nWe'll want to eliminate the influence of θ3x3θ^3 and θ4x4θ^4. Without actually getting rid of these features or changing the form of our hypothesis, we can instead modify our cost function:\n     \nWe've added two extra terms at the end to inflate the cost of θ3 and θ4. Now, in order for the cost function to get close to zero, we will have to reduce the values of θ3 and θ4 to near zero. This will in turn greatly reduce the values of θ3x3θ3 and θ4x4θ4 in our hypothesis function. As a result, we see that the new hypothesis (depicted by the pink curve) looks like a quadratic function but fits the data better due to the extra small terms θ3x3θ3 and θ4x4θ4.\nWe could also regularize all of our theta parameters in a single summation as:\n\nThe λ, or lambda, is the regularization parameter. It determines how much the costs of our theta parameters are inflated.\nUsing the above cost function with the extra summation, we can smooth the output of our hypothesis function to reduce overfitting. If lambda is chosen to be too large, it may smooth out the function too much and cause underfitting. Hence, what would happen if λ = 0 or is too small ?\n\nRegularized Linear Regression\nWe can apply regularization to both linear regression and logistic regression. We will approach linear regression first.\nGradient Descent\nWe will modify our gradient descent function to separate out θ0 from the rest of the parameters because we do not want to penalize θ0.\n\nThe term (λ\\m) * θj performs our regularization. With some manipulation our update rule can also be represented as:\n\nThe first term in the above equation, 1 − α * (λ\\m) will always be less than 1. Intuitively you can see it as reducing the value of θj by some amount on every update. Notice that the second term is now exactly the same as it was before.\nNormal Equation\nNow let's approach regularization using the alternate method of the non-iterative normal equation.\nTo add in regularization, the equation is the same as our original, except that we add another term inside the parentheses:\n\nL is a matrix with 0 at the top left and 1's down the diagonal, with 0's everywhere else. It should have dimension (n+1)×(n+1). Intuitively, this is the identity matrix (though we are not including x0), multiplied with a single real number λ.\nRecall that if m , then X'T is non-invertible. However, when we add the term λ⋅L, then X'X + λ⋅L becomes invertible.\nRegularized Logistic Regression\nWe can regularize logistic regression in a similar way that we regularize linear regression. As a result, we can avoid overfitting. The following image shows how the regularized function, displayed by the pink line, is less likely to overfit than the non-regularized function represented by the blue line:\n\nCost Function\nRecall that our cost function for logistic regression was:\n\nWe can regularize this equation by adding a term to the end:\n\nThe second sum, means to explicitly exclude the bias term, θ0. I.e. the θ vector is indexed from 0 to n (holding n+1 values, θ0 through θn), and this sum explicitly skips θ0 , by running from 1 to n, skipping 0. Thus, when computing the equation, we should continuously update the two following equations:\n\n"},"Week_3/Octave_MatlabTutorials/LogisticRegression_Example.html":{"url":"Week_3/Octave_MatlabTutorials/LogisticRegression_Example.html","title":"Solving Logistic Regression","keywords":"","body":"Logistic Regression Example\nIn this exercise, you will implement logistic regression and apply it to two different datasets.\nIn this part of the exercise, you will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.\nSuppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams.
